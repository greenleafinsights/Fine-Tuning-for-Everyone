# Fine-Tuning-for-Everyone

## Philosophies & Motivations

In an era where AI’s transformative potential often hinges on massive cloud services and prohibitive costs, we built this repository to champion a more localized, accessible, and user-centric approach. By keeping models and data on-premises, we reduce the risk of privacy violations, meet regulatory constraints, and allow anyone—regardless of economic might—to harness the power of advanced AI. Our goal is not just to produce sophisticated technology but to give individuals and small organizations a clear, replicable way to process their own documents, generate custom datasets, and refine AI models without leaning on sprawling external APIs.

We also acknowledge the critical shortage of high-quality, domain-specific data required for fine-tuning or specialized tasks. Rather than depending on generic corpora that rarely fit industrial or personal needs, this pipeline enables users to craft a tailored Q&A dataset from their own documents. In doing so, we hope to democratize AI, bridging the gap between well-funded institutions and the broader community of innovators who lack massive compute resources. We envision a future where security, affordability, and creativity coexist, empowering everyone to produce and refine AI in an environment free from vendor lock-in or uncertain cloud availability.

## High-Level Overview

1. **Local & Secure**: Everything runs on your own machine—no external APIs required—protecting confidential data.  
2. **Small Models**: Leverage moderate-sized models (e.g., \~2GB Llama 3.2) that run on typical CPU/GPU hardware.  
3. **Custom QA Dataset**: Converts local PDF files into a synthetic Q&A dataset—fully offline.  
4. **Straightforward Pipeline**: From PDF ingestion through question–answer generation, each step is clearly laid out for quick adoption.

## Setup

1. **Upgrade pip**  
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   ```
2. **Prepare Model Directory**  
   ```bash
   mkdir models
   curl -L https://huggingface.co/hantian/yolo-doclaynet/resolve/main/yolov11s-doclaynet.pt \
        -o ./models/yolov11s-doclaynet.pt
   ```
3. **Install Requirements**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Pull Ollama Models**  
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.2
   ollama pull granite-embedding
   ```
5. **Set Up Input Folders**  
   ```bash
   mkdir input
   mkdir input/pdfs
   # Place PDF files into input/pdfs
   ```
6. **Run**  
   ```bash
   python3 synthetic_data_generator.py
   ```

## Future Directions

- **Consistent QA Format**: Ensure the generated Q&A pairs follow a strict, machine-readable schema—crucial if you plan on fine-tuning GPT or Azure.  
- **Masking Sensitive Information**: Include mechanisms to automatically redact or anonymize proprietary/PII data in the final dataset.  
- **Low/No-Code Tools**: Move toward a streamlined GUI or command-line wizard so non-developers can generate datasets easily.  
- **Deeper Customization**: Offer more advanced chunking, retrieval strategies, and model integration options for power users.  
- **Community Contributions**: We welcome collaboration and hope others will expand and refine this pipeline, furthering the vision of secure, efficient, and affordable on-device AI.

We offer sincere gratitude to the **open-source community**—in particular, the **ollama** community—for pioneering local AI solutions that empower individuals and small organizations, and **ultralytics** for releasing groundbreaking models for public use. Their tireless efforts exemplify the spirit of AI democratization and have greatly inspired the work in this repository.
